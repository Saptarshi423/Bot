 # TELEGRAM BOT 
Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users 
can interact with bots by sending them messages.
Telegram has an existing bot API that allows us to connect bots to their system and also provides ways for us to 
use this API to control these bots. This project is a simple telegram bot that can be used to search word meanings. 
User can simple simply enter the word and the bot would automatically reply back with the meaning of that word by getting the
data from Oxford Dictionary API.
